Module 1 – Eye Tracking & EAR Detection
This module initializes the webcam, detects the face using MediaPipe FaceMesh, tracks both eyes, and calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to determine whether the eyes are open or closed.
It forms the foundation for blink classification and Morse-code communication in the full BlinkTalker system.
