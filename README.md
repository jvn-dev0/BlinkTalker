🔵 BlinkTalker
BlinkTalker is an AI-powered eye-blink communication and safety-monitoring system.
It uses webcam-based eye tracking, blink detection, gaze direction, Morse-code translation, stress estimation, and danger prediction to help users communicate using only their eyes.

A powerful mini-project combining Computer Vision + Machine Learning + Human–AI Interaction.
